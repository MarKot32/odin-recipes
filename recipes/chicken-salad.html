        This recipe for homemade chicken salad uses six simple ingredients and
        takes only 10 minutes to make from start to finish. After that, you can
        serve it up on salad greens, scoop it into pita bread or half an
        avocado, roll it up in a tortilla for a wrap, or serve it hot in a
        quesadilla or chicken melt.

      <h3>Chicken Salad Ingredients:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Chicken: You'll need cooked chicken, chopped or shredded. If you have
          leftover roast chicken, grilled chicken, or rotisserie chicken,
          chicken salad is a great way to use it all up. You can also use canned
          chicken to make chicken salad (drain it first), or you can cook
          chicken for chicken salad. Use white or dark meat, or a combination of
          both if you prefer.
        </li>
        <li>
          Mayonnaise: Creamy mayonnaise binds together all the separate
          ingredients for chicken salad into a satisfying mixture of flavors and
          textures. Use your choice of regular or reduced fat mayonnaise. In
          this chicken salad recipe, the mayonnaise is enhanced with a
          tablespoon of lemon juice for brightness and a Â¼ teaspoon of ground
          black pepper. Taste the dressing before mixing it with the chicken;
          you may find it needs a little salt or other flavor-booster from your
          spice collection.
        </li>
        <li>
          Celery: Fresh, crisp celery adds both flavor and crunch. Be sure to
          chop the celery into small, uniform pieces so it's easier to eat.
        </li>
        <li>
          Almonds: Here's the secret ingredient that makes this chicken salad
          recipe stand apart. Blanched slivered almonds (available at any
          grocery store) are quickly pan-toasted to bring out their nutty
          flavor, and then added to the chicken salad mixture.
